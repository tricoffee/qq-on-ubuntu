Icon Build Status Version Download Gitter

Translate Shell (formerly Google Translate CLI) is a command-line translator powered by Google Translate (default), Bing Translator, Yandex.Translate and Apertium. It gives you easy access to one of these translation engines your terminal:

    $ trans 'Saluton, Mondo!'
    Saluton, Mondo!

    Hello, World!

    Translations of Saluton, Mondo!
    [ Esperanto -> English ]
    Saluton ,
        Hello,
    Mondo !
        World!

By default, translations with detailed explanations are shown. You can also translate the text briefly: (only the most relevant translation will be shown)

    $ trans -brief 'Saluton, Mondo!'
    Hello, World!

Translate Shell can also be used like an interactive shell; input the text to be translated line by line:

    $ trans -shell -brief
    > Rien ne réussit comme le succès.
    Nothing succeeds like success.
    > Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stärker.
    What does not kill me makes me stronger.
    > Юмор есть остроумие глубокого чувства.
    Humor has a deep sense of wit.
    > 學而不思則罔，思而不學則殆。
    Learning without thought is labor lost, thought without learning is perilous.
    > 幸福になるためには、人から愛されるのが一番の近道。
    In order to be happy, the best way is to be loved by people.

Prerequisites
System Requirements

Translate Shell is known to work on many POSIX-compliant systems, including but not limited to:

    GNU/Linux
    OS X
    FreeBSD
    Windows (Cygwin or MSYS2)

Dependencies

    GNU Awk (gawk) 4.0 or later
        This program relies heavily on GNU extensions of the AWK language, which are non-portable for other AWK implementations (e.g. nawk).
        How to get gawk:
            gawk comes with all GNU/Linux distributions.
            On FreeBSD, gawk is available in the ports.
            On OS X, gawk is available in MacPorts and Homebrew.
    GNU Bash or Zsh
        You may use Translate Shell from any Unix shell of your choice (bash, zsh, ksh, tcsh, fish, etc.); however, the wrapper script requires either bash or zsh installed.

Recommended Dependencies

These dependencies are optional, but strongly recommended for full functionality:

    curl with OpenSSL support
    GNU FriBidi: an implementation of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (bidi)
        required for displaying text in Right-to-Left scripts (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew)
    mplayer, mplayer2, mpv, mpg123, or eSpeak
        required for the Text-to-Speech functionality
    less, more or most
        required for terminal paging
    rlwrap: a GNU readline wrapper
        required for readline-style editing and history in the interactive shell

Environment and Fonts

It is a must to have corresponding fonts for the language(s) / script(s) you wish to display in your terminal. See wiki: Writing Systems and Fonts for more details on scripts and recommended Unicode fonts.
Try It Out!

Start an interactive shell and translate anything you input into your native language: (in bash or zsh)

    $ gawk -f <(curl -Ls git.io/translate) -shell

(in fish)

    $ gawk -f (curl -Ls git.io/translate | psub) -shell

Installation
Option #1. Direct Download

Download the self-contained executable and place it into your path. It's everything you need.

    $ wget git.io/trans
    $ chmod +x ./trans

There is a GPG signature.
Option #2. From A Package Manager
Using Antigen (Recommended for Zsh users)

Add the following line to your .zshrc:

    antigen bundle soimort/translate-shell

Using your favorite package manager

See wiki: Distros on how to install from a specific package manager on your distro.
Option #3. From Git (Recommended for seasoned hackers)

    $ git clone https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell
    $ cd translate-shell/
    $ make
    $ [sudo] make install

In case you have only zsh but not bash in your system, build with:

    $ make TARGET=zsh

The default PREFIX of installation is /usr/local. To install the program to somewhere else (e.g. /usr, ~/.local), use:

    $ [sudo] make PREFIX=/usr install

Getting Started by Examples
Translate a Word
From any language to your language

Google Translate can identify the language of the source text automatically, and Translate Shell by default translates the source text into the language of your locale.

    $ trans vorto

From any language to one or more specific languages

Translate a word into French:

    $ trans :fr word

Translate a word into Chinese and Japanese: (use a plus sign "+" as the delimiter)

    $ trans :zh+ja word

Alternatively, equals sign ("=") can be used in place of the colon (":"). Note that in some shells (e.g. zsh), equals signs may be interpreted differently, therefore the argument specifying languages needs to be protected:

    $ trans {=zh+ja} word
    $ trans '=zh+ja' word

You can also use the -target (-t) option to specify the target language(s):

    $ trans -t zh+ja word

From a specific language

Google Translate may wrongly identify the source text as some other language than you expected:

    $ trans 手紙

In that case, you need to specify its language explicitly:

    $ trans ja: 手紙
    $ trans zh: 手紙

You can also use the -source (-s) option to specify the source language:

    $ trans -s ja 手紙

Translate Multiple Words or a Phrase

Translate each word alone:

    $ trans en:zh word processor

Put words into one argument, and translate them as a whole:

    $ trans en:zh "word processor"

Translate a Sentence

Translating a sentence is much the same like translating a phrase; you can just quote the sentence into one argument:

    $ trans :zh "To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,"
    $ trans :zh 'To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,'

It is also possible to translate multi-line sentences:

   $ trans :zh "Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
   > To the last syllable of recorded time;
   > And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
   > The way to dusty death."
  
To avoid punctuation marks (e.g. "!") or other special characters being interpreted by the shell, use single quotes:

    $ trans :zh 'Out, out, brief candle!'

There are some cases though, you may still want to use double quotes: (e.g. the sentence contains a single quotation mark "'")

    $ trans :zh "Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player"

Brief Mode

By default, Translate Shell displays translations in a verbose manner. If you prefer to see only the most relevant translation, there is a brief mode available using the -brief (-b) option:

    $ trans -b :fr "Saluton, Mondo"

In brief mode, phonetic notation (if any) is not shown by default. To enable this, put an at sign "@" in front of the language code:

    $ trans -b :@ja "Saluton, Mondo"

Dictionary Mode

Google Translate can be used as a dictionary. When translating a word and the target language is the same as the source language, the dictionary entry of the word is shown:

    $ trans :en word

To enable dictionary mode no matter whether the source language and the target language are identical, use the -dictionary (-d) option.

    $ trans -d fr: mot

Note: Not every language supported by Google Translate has provided dictionary data. See wiki: Languages to find out which language(s) has dictionary support.
Language Identification

Use the -identify (-id) option to identify the language of the text:

    $ trans -id 言葉

Text-to-Speech

Use the -play (-p) option to listen to the translation:

    $ trans -b -p :ja "Saluton, Mondo"

Use the -speak (-sp) option to listen to the original text:

    $ trans -sp "你好，世界"

Terminal Paging

Sometimes the content of translation can be too much for display in one screen. Use the -view (-v) option to view the translation in a terminal pager such as less or more:

    $ trans -d -v word

Right-to-Left (RTL) Languages

Right-to-Left (RTL) languages are well supported via GNU FriBidi.

The program will automatically adjust the screen width for padding when displaying right-to-left languages. Alternatively, you may use the -width (-w) option to specify the screen width:

    $ trans -b -w 40 :he "Saluton, Mondo"

See wiki: Languages to find out which language(s) uses a Right-to-Left writing system.
Pipeline, Input and Output

If no source text is given in command-line arguments, the program will read from standard input, or from the file specified by the -input (-i) option:

    $ echo "Saluton, Mondo" | trans -b :fr
    $ trans -b -i input.txt :fr

Translations are written to standard output, or to the file specified by the -output (-o) option:

    $ echo "Saluton, Mondo" | trans -b -o output.txt :fr

Translate a File

Instead of using the -input option, a file URI scheme (file:// followed by the file name) can be used as a command-line argument:

    $ trans :fr file://input.txt

Note: Brief mode is used when translating from file URI schemes.
Translate a Web Page

To translate a web page, an http(s) URI scheme can be used as an argument:

    $ trans :fr http://www.w3.org/

A browser session will open for viewing the translation (via Google Translate's web interface). To specify your web browser of choice, use the -browser option:

    $ trans -browser firefox :fr http://www.w3.org/

Language Details

Use the -list (-L) option to view details of one or more languages:

    $ trans -L fr
    $ trans -L de+en

Some basic information of the language will be displayed: its English name and endonym (language name in the language itself), language family, writing system, canonical Google Translate code and ISO 639-3 code.
Interactive Translate Shell (REPL)

Start an interactive shell using the -shell (or -interactive, -I) option:

    $ trans -shell

You may specify the source language and the target language(s) before starting an interactive shell:

    $ trans -shell en:fr

You may also change these settings during an interactive session. See wiki: REPL for more advanced usage of the interactive Translate Shell.
